"The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors"

The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors

(1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors)

(0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won)
